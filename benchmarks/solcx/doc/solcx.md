# The SolCx Stokes benchmark

The SolCx benchmark is intended to test the accuracy of the solution to a
problem that has a large jump in the viscosity along a line through the
domain. Such situations are common in geophysics: for example, the viscosity
in a cold, subducting slab is much larger than in the surrounding, relatively
hot mantle material.

The SolCx benchmark computes the Stokes flow field of a fluid driven by
spatial density variations, subject to a spatially variable viscosity.
Specifically, the domain is $\Omega=[0,1]^2$, gravity is $\mathbf
g=(0,-1)^T$ and the density is given by
$\rho(\mathbf x)=\sin(\pi x_1)\cos(\pi x_2)$; this can be considered a density
perturbation to a constant background density. The viscosity is
$$\begin{aligned}
  \eta(\mathbf x) = \left\{
    \begin{matrix}
      1 & \text{for}\ x_1 \le 0.5, \\
      10^6 & \text{for}\ x_1  > 0.5.
    \end{matrix}
  \right.\end{aligned}$$ This strongly discontinuous viscosity field yields an
almost stagnant flow in the right half of the domain and consequently a
singularity in the pressure along the interface. Boundary conditions are free
slip on all of $\partial\Omega$. The temperature plays no role in this
benchmark. The prescribed density field and the resulting velocity field are
shown in Fig.&nbsp;[2][].

The SolCx benchmark was previously used in (Duretz et al. 2011, sec. 4.1.1)
(references to earlier uses of the benchmark are available there) and its
analytic solution is given in (Zhong 1996). contains an implementation of this
analytic solution taken from the Underworld package (see (Moresi et al. 2007)
and <http://www.underworldproject.org/>, and correcting for the mismatch in
sign between the implementation and the description in (Duretz et al. 2011)).

To run this benchmark, the following input file will do (see the files in
[benchmarks/solcx/][] to rerun the benchmark):

``` prmfile
```

Since this is the first cookbook in the benchmarking section, let us go
through the different parts of this file in more detail:

-   The material model and the postprocessor

-   The first part consists of parameter setting for overall parameters.
    Specifically, we set the dimension in which this benchmark runs to two and
    choose an output directory. Since we are not interested in a time
    dependent solution, we set the end time equal to the start time, which
    results in only a single time step being computed.

    The last parameter of this section, `Pressure normalization`, is set in
    such a way that the pressure is chosen so that its *domain* average is
    zero, rather than the pressure along the surface, see
    Section&nbsp;[\[sec:pressure\]][1].

-   The next part of the input file describes the setup of the benchmark.
    Specifically, we have to say how the geometry should look like (a box of
    size $1\times 1$) and what the velocity boundary conditions shall be
    (tangential flow all around &ndash; the box geometry defines four boundary
    indicators for the left, right, bottom and top boundaries, see also
    Section&nbsp;[\[parameters:Geometry_20model\]][3]). This is followed by
    subsections choosing the material model (where we choose a particular
    model implemented in that describes the spatially variable density and
    viscosity fields, along with the size of the viscosity jump) and finally
    the chosen gravity model (a gravity field that is the constant vector
    $(0,-1)^T$, see Section&nbsp;[\[parameters:Gravity_20model\]][4]).

-   The part that follows this describes the boundary and initial values for
    the temperature. While we are not interested in the evolution of the
    temperature field in this benchmark, we nevertheless need to set
    something. The values given here are the minimal set of inputs.

-   The second-to-last part sets discretization parameters. Specifically, it
    determines what kind of Stokes element to choose (see
    Section&nbsp;[\[parameters:Discretization\]][5] and the extensive
    discussion in (Kronbichler, Heister, and Bangerth 2012)). We do not
    adaptively refine the mesh but only do four global refinement steps at the
    very beginning. This is obviously a parameter worth playing with.

-   The final section on postprocessors determines what to do with the
    solution once computed. Here, we do two things: we ask to compute the
    error in the solution using the setup described in the Duretz et
    al.&nbsp;paper (Duretz et al. 2011), and we request that output files for
    later visualization are generated and placed in the output directory. The
    functions that compute the error automatically query which kind of
    material model had been chosen, i.e., they can know whether we are solving
    the SolCx benchmark or one of the other benchmarks discussed in the
    following subsections.

Upon running with this input file, you will get output of the following kind
(obviously with different timings, and details of the output may also change
as development of the code continues):

One can then visualize the solution in a number of different ways (see
Section&nbsp;[\[sec:viz\]][6]), yielding pictures like those shown in
Fig.&nbsp;[2][]. One can also analyze the error as shown in various different
ways, for example as a function of the mesh refinement level, the element
chosen, etc.; we have done so extensively in (Kronbichler, Heister, and
Bangerth 2012).
